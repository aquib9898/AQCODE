when working with react apps/components and applyinf css styles to them, always remember to apply a css to the root object in which your app will be placed. example:

#root {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  width: 100vw;
}


when working with useState for CSS properties, the state is inserted into the element's tag using :
style={{cssAttribute:reactiveVariable:}}

note: as the reactive variable is used in place of property, the dashes are converted to camelcase to mimic javascript objects 
example: background-color   ------>    backgroundColor
